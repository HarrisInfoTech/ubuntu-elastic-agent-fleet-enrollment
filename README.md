# ubuntu-elastic-agent-fleet-enrollment
Deployed an Ubuntu 24.04 server on Vultr, SSHâ€™d in to update packages, created a Linux-policy in Kibana, and enrolled the Elastic Agent. Hit a self-signed certificate error, re-ran with --insecure for the lab, and confirmed data in Discover (now seeing 3 hosts)
